This morning after I started my PC, the error message keeps popping up, telling me that ‘Windows detected a hard disk problem’ and asking me to start the backup process. 
It was quite confusing, and I don’t know how did this problem happen to my computer. 
 I’m wondering what reasons can cause a hard disk problem and how can I fix this issue.
Help me if you know how to fix hard disk problem on Windows PC. I’m using Windows 8.
This problem has been bothering almost all Windows users for quite a long period.
You can selectively copy and paste single files and documents one by one into another secure storage devices.
Command will scan all protected system files and replace all corrupted files with a backup copy.
After the process is finished, your hard disk would work properly again.
